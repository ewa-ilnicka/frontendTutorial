## About The Project

<img src="assets/about.png" alt="View">

This repo is still under construction. I'm planning to update it once a week with new chapters and new code.
This isn't full tutorial. It contains only code and some comments (some of them are in polish). It also contains some exercises and solutions for them. 

In this repo:
* each chapter contains some basics od html and css
* I try to use english but there are some polish comments
* tools used: Visual Studio Code and Git.

I am no frontend master or pro - I'm still learning and this repo helps me to organize my frontend knowledge
